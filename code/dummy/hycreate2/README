Tests with HyCreate

Summarized result: If the SpaceEx model is analyzed with HyCreate 2.81 (after conversion with Hyst), the computed reachable set is incorrect, even contradicting HyCreate's own simulations.

Due to multiple issues in Hyst and HyCreate this test is not run automatically.


Use Hyst and HyCreate 2.81 in a Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine. (Should also work with HyCreate 2.8).

Open a terminal in the current directory.
Hycreate must be launched with this working directory so that it uses the SETTINGS.XML file.
(To work around problems on newer OpenJDK versions (>8), the "security sandbox" was disabled in the settings.)

# Test1
original spaceEx file (example A1)

# Test1-converted
test1 converted with hyst, fails with syntax error.

# Test1-converted-fixed
test1 converted with hyst and modified so that it runs:
(This is due to bug https://github.com/verivital/hyst/issues/50 )
Opened in Hycreate, manually fixed syntax errors (added missing $ in front of "Transition: Reset action" variable names), Model options: enabled "simulation and reachability", simulation settings: "Starting position: midpoint and corners, enumerate transitions: on"
Save file
Compile and Compute
Move the results/ directory to test1-converted-fixed_result_hycreate
Result: Computed reachable set is too small, only covers 0<=tau<=0.5, whereas -0.5<=tau<0 is completely missing.

# Test2
Test1, but guard changed from tau==0.5 to tau>=0.45

# Test2-converted
test2 converted with Hyst

# Test2-converted-fixed
test2 converted with Hyst, modified and processed as test1-converted-fixed.
Result: Simulated set is larger than reachable set, there must be a problem!
